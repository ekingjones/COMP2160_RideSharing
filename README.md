# COMP2160 Carpool App / Tag Along
Introduction:
----------------------------------
We are a team of four computer science students based at Thompson Rivers University, in the lower main-land of beautiful British Columbia! This is an Android app, and the term project for course COMP 2160, Mobile Applications.

The Basics:
----------------------
This is a car-pooling app, designed to help people in our community get to where they are going, in a fast, safe and fun way. We were motivated to build this app in large part due to the announcement that the Greyhound will be ending most of it's Western Canadian routes, and for those without a car, or on a budget this really cuts down on the opportunity to see most of our beautiful province. We want to build a community driven system that lets people travel and experience this area and beyond!

Proposed Features: 
---------------------
For Drivers:
  - Ability to choose destination, route, departure date and time, and available capacity
  - Pricing: driver can set price per kilometer, or flat seat price
  - Amenities: Things like wheelchair accessible seating, USB ports, heating/AC (or lack thereof)
  - Trip planning: traffic advisories, best routes, number of seats purchased/still available, time until departure
  - Passenger rating system
  
  For Passengers:
   - Define a destination or preferred route and departure date and time
   - Ability to see a list of trips based on defined parameters, with filters for things like price, total distance, etc.
   - Ability to book round trip if necessary
   - Pay driver within the app, with most standard payment methods(debit, VISA, MasterCard, etc..)
   
   Contributions and Feedback:
   --------------------
   As for right now, we will not be adding or accepting any other code contributors. This is to maintain academic integrity, as this is still an academic project, however we are open to adding contributors in the future, and welcome user and community feedback. This app is planned to be published in the Google Play app store, so we hope to have user and community
